    "Management has been long emphasized as an important factor of the success of a company. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence mostly due to limited data. This project contributes to the literature by looking at what successful firms are looking for when they hire a manager.  Using 15 millions of management job postings all over the US from 2012-2016, the objective is to explore what features of management job postings can predict a firmâ€™s performance (for example, profitability, stock market movement).   \n"
