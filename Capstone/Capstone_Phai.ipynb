    "\n",
    "What drives a company’s success? Undeniably, one important factor is the people, and the starting point would be the vacancy posts. Using the merged dataset from CareerBuilder and Compustat, this project aims to understand how vacancy posting can help with a company's success. Section 2 demonstrates how to process raw posting data, and how to apply fuzzy string matching algorithm to match job posting company names and Compustat legal company names. Section 3 provides some basic exploration and visualization of the data. Section 4 applies several machine learning algorithms to predict a company’s profitability using information on education level requirements, locations and industry sectors. The model provides a product recommending education level requirement when posting a job. Section 5 incorporates job titles to the algorithm. The results provide several interesting insights. Section 6 concludes and provides some possible future work and extensions.      \n",
